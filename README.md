# Financial Database Project

## Overview
This project utilizes the **Financial** database, which contains anonymized data about loans and their repayment statuses. The database is built on real-world data from a Czech bank, anonymized to ensure privacy and enable public use.

The dataset offers valuable insights into financial behavior and includes data for over **5,300 clients**, nearly **1 million transactions**, approximately **700 loans**, and around **900 issued credit cards**.
